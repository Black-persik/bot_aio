Cohesion

- Telegram Bot is responsible only for receiving and sending messages to the user.

- Middleware handles the processing and routing of requests between components.

- The Database Connector implements all the logic of accessing the database.

- LLM is solely responsible for generating responses based on the received data.

- The database stores all the necessary information and query history.


Coupling

- Telegram Bot does not interact directly with either the LLM or the database â€” it only works with Middleware.

- Middleware acts as the central link, receiving requests from the bot, accessing the database through the Database Connector and interacting with the LLM to receive a response.
